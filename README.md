__Report:__ Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a Python program with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

# Implementation:
The program is implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for creating the GUI. The Caesar Cipher algorithm is used for both encryption and decryption of the text input by the user.

# Features:
__Encryption:__ Users can input a message and a shift value, and the program encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
__Decryption:__ Users can input an encrypted message and the corresponding shift value, and the program decrypts the message to reveal the original text.
__User-friendly GUI:__ The program provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface for users to interact with.
__Input Validation:__ The program ensures that the input provided by the user for the shift value is a valid integer.

# Functionality:
When the user launches the program, a window with input fields for the message and shift value is displayed.
The user enters the message and selects either the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button based on their desired operation.
If encryption is chosen, the program encrypts the message using the provided shift value and displays the encrypted message in a message box.
If decryption is chosen, the program decrypts the message using the provided shift value and displays the decrypted message in a message box.
The program provides feedback in case of invalid input or errors during encryption/decryption.

# Sample Usage:
User inputs a message: "Hello World" and selects shift value as 3. Then, the user clicks on the "Encrypt" button. The program returns the encrypted message: "Khoor Zruog".
User inputs an encrypted message: "Khoor Zruog" and selects shift value as 3. Then, the user clicks on the "Decrypt" button. The program returns the decrypted message: "Hello World".

# Conclusion:
The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption program provide a convenient way for users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using a simple graphical interface. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the basic principles of cryptography and provides a hands-on experience with the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The program can be further enhanced by adding additional features such as error handling, support for special characters, and options for choosing different encryption algorithms.
